# {{ GP }} host classes

The host class determines the computing power allocated for each host in the cluster. In a {{ mgp-name }} cluster, the classes of master hosts and segment hosts may differ. Once a cluster is created, you cannot change its host classes.


The host class affects the list of available [disk types](./storage.md):

* For master hosts:

   * **s2**, **i2**: `local-ssd`.
   * **s3**: `network-ssd`, `network-hdd`, `local-ssd`, `network-ssd-nonreplicated`.
   * **i3**: `network-ssd`, `network-hdd`, `network-ssd-nonreplicated`.

* For segment hosts:

   * **s2**, **i2**: `local-ssd`.
   * **s3**, **i3**: `network-ssd-nonreplicated`.

The available storage doesn't depend on the host class. For storage limitations, see [{#T}](limits.md).

## Available host classes {#available-flavors}


{{ mgp-name }} cluster hosts are deployed on {{ compute-full-name }} virtual machines on Intel Cascade Lake and Intel Ice Lake [platforms](../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md) with a guaranteed vCPU share of 100%. The full list of possible host configurations is provided below.

Configuration types:
